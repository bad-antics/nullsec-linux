## r/netsec - Security News and Discussion
**Title:** NullSec Linux - Security distro focused on automotive and embedded systems hacking

**Body:**
I've been working on NullSec Linux, a security-focused distribution with 135+ pre-configured tools. What makes it different:

- **Automotive Security Edition** - CAN bus tools, OBD-II diagnostic, ECU fuzzing
- **Hardware Hacking** - JTAG/SWD debugging, UART exploitation, SPI/I2C tools
- **Cloud Pentest Edition** - AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s security auditing
- **AI/ML Security** - LLM red teaming, prompt injection testing

Architectures: AMD64, ARM64, RISC-V, Apple Silicon (Asahi)

GitHub: https://github.com/bad-antics/nullsec-linux

Looking for feedback from the community on what tools/features would be most useful.

## r/cybersecurity - Cybersecurity Professionals
**Title:** Building a security-focused Linux distro - feedback wanted

**Body:**
I've been developing NullSec Linux as a pentesting platform, currently at v5.0 with 135+ tools.

**What sets it apart:**
- Specialized editions (Cloud, AI/ML, Hardware, Automotive)
- Multi-architecture (AMD64, ARM64, RISC-V, Apple Silicon)
- Integrated automotive security tools (CAN bus, ECU testing)

Would love feedback from the community:
- What tools are missing from current distros like Kali/Parrot?
- Any interest in automotive/embedded systems security focus?

## r/oscp - OSCP Certification
**Title:** NullSec Linux - Alternative to Kali for OSCP prep

**Body:**
For those preparing for OSCP, I built NullSec Linux as an alternative pentesting platform:

**Why consider it:**
- All standard pentesting tools (nmap, burp, metasploit, etc.)
- Additional cloud security tools for modern environments
- Cleaner base with focused tool selection
- Multi-architecture support (including ARM for labs)

Happy to add any tools the OSCP community recommends!
